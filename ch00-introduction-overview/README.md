Introduction to Kubernetes:

Kubernetes, commonly referred to as K8s , is an open-source container orchestration platform. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 

Kubernetes provides a framework for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows you to abstract the underlying infrastructure and provides a unified API to manage and control your applications across a cluster of machines.

Key features of Kubernetes include:

1. Container orchestration: Kubernetes manages the scheduling and distribution of containers across a cluster of nodes, ensuring that applications run efficiently and reliably.

2. Service discovery and load balancing: Kubernetes provides mechanisms for automatically discovering services and distributing network traffic among containers.

3. Scaling and self-healing: Kubernetes enables automatic scaling of application replicas based on defined policies and ensures that failed containers are restarted or replaced.

4. Automated rollouts and rollbacks: Kubernetes supports rolling updates and rollbacks of application deployments, allowing you to seamlessly update your applications without downtime.

5. Persistent storage management: Kubernetes provides abstractions for managing persistent storage volumes, allowing applications to store and retrieve data independent of the underlying infrastructure.

6. Security and access control: Kubernetes provides features for securing and isolating workloads, including network policies, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

7. Monitoring and logging: Kubernetes integrates with various monitoring and logging solutions to provide visibility into the health and performance of applications and the cluster itself.

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying and managing containerized applications. It enables organizations to build scalable, resilient, and portable application architectures, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale applications in a distributed environment.
